# Running the game
There are 2 things you need to make sure to do, in order to run the game.
1. Include the original assets in the folder as either WAD files or as folder/folders.
2. Add the proper path to priorities.txt (read the comments aswell). It is important to use the config file in the Data directory, since there are some slight additions. In the priorities "Data" should be the last specified. So your own assets must be specified any line above that.
